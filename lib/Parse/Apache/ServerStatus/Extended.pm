=head1 NAME

Parse::Apache::ServerStatus::Extended - Simple module to parse apache's extended server-status.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Parse::Apache::ServerStatus::Extended;

    my $parser = Parse::Apache::ServerStatus::Extended->new;

    $parser->request(
       url     => 'http://localhost/server-status',
       timeout => 30
    ) or die $parser->errstr;

    my $stat = $parser->parse or die $parser->errstr;

    # or both in one step

    my $stats = $parser->get(
       url     => 'http://localhost/server-status',
       timeout => 30
    ) or die $parser->errstr;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module parses the content of apache's extended server-status.It works nicely with
apache versions 1.3 and 2.x.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Call C<new()> to create a new Parse::Apache::ServerStatus::Extended object.

=head2 request()

This method excepts one or two arguments: C<url> and C<timeout>. It requests the url
and safes the content into the object. The option C<timeout> is set to 180 seconds if
it is not set.

=head2 parse()

Call C<parse()> to parse the extended server status. This method returns an array reference with
the parsed content.

It's possible to call C<parse()> with the content as argument.

    my $stat = $prs->parse($content);

If no argument is passed then C<parse()> looks into the object for the content that is
stored by C<request()>.

=head2 get()

Call C<get()> to C<request()> and C<parse()> in one step. It except the same options like
C<request()> and returns the array reference that is returned by C<parse()>.
